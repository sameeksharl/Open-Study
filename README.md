# Open-Study

The pandemic has disrupted education and forced teachers to rely on technology in new ways. Students and teachers are both suffering in major ways , with students lethargically attending to their assignments and now “online tests”  . The online mode of classes has also caused a lot of the teachers to be unprofessional during the class and they also tend to make lewd comments as most of them are not under supervision.

Our project - OpenStudy targets all these problems with various solutions like summarized notes of the online class , spam/bad word detection , emailing parents the grades received by their ward and all in all a platform that helps them keep their assignments and tests in track .
